jaxb2-episode-ext
=================

Simple Fork of the original JAXB XJC "episode"-Plugin with some additional features.
Currently: It adds the "if-exists" attribute to namespaces, in order to allow consumers to ignore some of the declared namespaces from the episode.
It is planned to add an option to exclude non-exportable namespaces from the episode altogether.
